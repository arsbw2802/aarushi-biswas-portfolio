            <p>
              Hello! My name is Aarushi Biswas. I am a Master's student at the Georgia University of Technology
              studying Computational Science and Engineering. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I graduated with honors and made Dean;s List for Spring 2020, 2021 and 2022 semesters.
              Some notable courses that I took at UIUC include Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Systems architecture, Linear Algebra, Statistics and Probability,  Artificial Intelligence, 
              Machine Learning, Database Systems Management, Web Development and Natural Language Processing.
              In addition to my major in Computer Engineering, I also minored in Business Administration. 

            </p>
            <p>
              I am particularly interested in <b> Data Science, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing </b> and <b> Full-Stack Web Development </b>. 
              I have prior experience in additional fields such as <b> Software Development, Product Management, Database Management, UI/UX </b> and <b> Operating Systems </b>.
              through projects and internships at companies like Apple Inc, Robert Bosch and a startup called Snyder Technologies LLC.

                The internship entailed building a Google Chrome extension which could perform Named Entity Recognition

                I interned with the Platform Services and Operations Team under CoreOS. I owned an independent project for 
                which I designed and implemented a scalable and automated system tool for UI testing of the Apple Virtual Platform. 
                To do so, I took help of the YOLOv5 object detection model and treated each UI element on screen as an object. 
                Additionally, I modified the virtualization framework using Objective-C to enable automatic screen recordings of the 
                Virtual platforms during and after boot-up which is fed into the UI testing tool.

                I utilized SQL and Excel to analyze large amounts of real time data retrieved from Digital Twins of small 
                sector machinery. I presented my findings of areas of low energy efficiency and gave suggestions on how energy 
                consumption can be improved. Additionally, I analyzed the data to ensure preemptive maintenance of machineries, 
                and to predict areas of potential operating challenges and asset breakdown events. Lastly, I conducted research 
                and wrote a research paper on how an IoT based technology (such as Digital Twin technology) can be paired with 
                Enterprise Asset management to solve real time problems.

                For our capstone project, we were asked to design and develop a working prototype of a unique and marketable product. 
                The end result was a device which should sit on the wrist of the user,  detect crucial sounds in the environment such 
                as the fire alarm, and notify the user in the form of unique visual and haptic feedback. The device’s heart is the 
                ESP32-C3 microcontroller that is responsible for processing and control of the entire system. The sounds are 
                captured and communicated with the microcontroller via the I2S protocol, which can process and run FFTs. C++ 
                libraries were utilized to perform FFTs for accurate sound detection, processing and feedback in under 10 seconds. 
                The project also involved designing a PCB which in addition to the microcontroller, utilized an I2S Mems Digital 
                Microphone, an I2C OLED display, two interrupt driven buttons, and a LRA coin vibration motor. The project received 
                the ‘Runner up for Best Bio-medical device’ award from the ECE department.

              <h1> GraderU </h1>
              <p>
                The ‘Grader-U’ project was a web app created for my web programming course. The idea came from my own frustrating 
                experience of having to reach out to multiple sources to decide on a course: a single ‘go to’ site would have made 
                this much easier. The response was to design and develop an application which offered students an integrated source 
                of all course information, along with a GPA calculator as a special feature. The project was based on the UIUC course 
                data published by our professor Wade A Fagen-ulmschneider and updated every semester. The data was cleaned and 
                processed to be used for the project. The application was created by utilizing MongoDB, Express.js, REACT and Node.js 
                (MERN). It includes features such as viewing a course’s historic data such as average GPAs, semesters offered and 
                professors who have taught the course. Users can both leave feedback and review other users’ feedback for a 
                particular course or a professor. The special feature of the GPA calculator allows the user to enter all their 
                courses for the semester along with the prediction of where they think they fall on the normal deviation bell curve 
                to find out their predicted GPA for the semester. This project acquired the ‘Most innovative project’ title at the 
                course’s app competition.

                In a group of 4, we collaborated to create a web application for a Movie recommendation generator utilizing the 
                IMDb database. We employed MySQL for database management, integrated Flutter and Flask frameworks, and interfaced 
                with REST APIs. We deployed the application on Google Cloud Platform for hosting. For database management, we 
                stored dataset in tables with primary and foreign keys to create database relationships and utilized Advanced SQL 
                features such as indexing, stored procedures and triggers on the tables to process user requests.

                language. Our Kernel had support for non-preemptive context switching, segmented memory protection, Paging, a
